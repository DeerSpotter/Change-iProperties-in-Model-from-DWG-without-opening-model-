# Change-iProperties-in-Model-from-DWG-without-opening-model-

will allow user to use ilogic code to change iproperties in model from a drawing. 
this will allow user to pass parameters back and forth without opening large assemblies to update them and save them.


All code here is in ilogic


My goal is to create code that can be easily integrated without much effort from the user themeselves, hopefully i can get a first
time use script to modify the ilogic code itself (iproperty to iproperty) to avoid possibly conflict with code when used.
